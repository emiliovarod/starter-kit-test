# Design System Architecture

## Token hierarchy
Primitives → Semantic → Component

Rules:
- Primitives define raw values only
- Semantic tokens map meaning to primitives
- Component tokens consume semantic tokens
- Components NEVER use primitives or semantic tokens directly
- No hardcoded values in components

## CSS rules
- One component = one CSS file
- Components do not style other components
- Layout is allowed, visual styling is not
- No global selectors in component CSS

## HTML rules
- HTML expresses intention, not design
- Use data-attributes for variants
- No utility classes in markup

## Theming
- Themes override semantic tokens only
